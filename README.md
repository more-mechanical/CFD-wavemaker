# CFD-wavemaker
This is a repository for my project trying to simulate a planar wavemaker in shallow water using OpenFOAM. Via blueCFD. Through this project I explore block meshes, setting fields, interfoam solver, and dynamic meshing.
Refer to walkthrough.pdf for understanding my methodology for setting up and running the simulation.
Note that: this is also my first github repository, so if there are better ways to set this up please feel free to reach out.
